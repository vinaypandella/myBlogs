<b> about myself in the third person </b>

Vinay Pandella joined Nisum Technologies in 2006 at a campus interview. Initially working as a software associate for the portal application, he now works as Team/Technical Lead at different client locations.
He is more passionate about technology, likes to talk about technology, products and growing startups.

He thinks like an entrepreneur [ is the dreamer, the visionary, and the creative mind ] and also thinks about return on investment (ROI), near-term success, and productivity like a 'manager' and also acts as a technician who gets the work done, follows the manager’s guidance and is concerned about today’s success.

He is a good problem solver with the ability of getting things to work.

He is a Full Stack Developer, not a mastery in many but with a genuine interest in all software technology he is kind of a guy with familiarity in each layer.He honed skills in both front-end web design/development and back-end/server coding including batch processing.
You can count on a full-stack web developer to design, code, implement and maintain a fully functional modern interactive website on his own (not just a static website with a few pages).He is competent member in cross-functional Agile teams.
